Installation
============

The jenkins-server is pre-built and stored as a Docker image. It can now be download from Docker Hub (an online Docker image repository) `here <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/clin864/jenkins-server>`_.

This documentation shows how to get and install the jenkins-server Docker image.

Prerequisites
=============

* Docker

Installation steps
==================

#. Pull the jenkins-server Docker image from Docker Hub

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo docker pull clin864/jenkins-server

   .. _Starting jenkins-server:

#. Starting jenkins-server

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo docker run -u root -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins_server:/var/jenkins_home clin864/jenkins-server

   .. note::

      By default, the web server will be hosted on port 8080 so you can visit it via http://localhost:8080/.
      You can also reset host port (-p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT) if needed.

      This command will automatically create a Docker volume named ``jenkins_server`` on the host machine if not exists.
      It is used to retain contents even when the container is stopped, restarted, or deleted.
      You can run ``sudo docker volume inspect jenkins_home`` to get the mountpoint of the volume in your host machine.

#. The first time you start jenkins-server, you will see a message printed on the terminal like this:

   .. code-block:: text

      Jenkins initial setup is required. An admin user has been created and a password generated.
      Please use the following password to proceed to installation:

      b7379465879043db8ac9d75309aa433b

      This may also be found at: /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
